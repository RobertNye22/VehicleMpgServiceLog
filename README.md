# VehicleMpgServiceLog
This is a web application using MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, and EJS stack. initially intended for my personal use to track and keep me informed of my MPG trends, along with tracking updates and upgrades to the vehicle via a service log. The application will show visual graphs of the mpg over time. This is most useful for old antique vehicles which dont have a built in gas tank sensor, or is broken. Or if you dont intend to use the system that way you can use it to track your service log over time.
