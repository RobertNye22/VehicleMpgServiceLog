# AutoLogix
AutoLogix is a web application using MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, and EJS stack. initially intended for my personal use to track and keep me informed of my MPG trends, along with tracking updates and upgrades to the vehicle via a service log. The application will show visual graphs of the mpg over time. This is most useful for old antique vehicles which dont have a built in gas tank sensor, or is broken. If you dont intend to use the system that way you will simply be able to use it to track your services done to your vehicle over time.
